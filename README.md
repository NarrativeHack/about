## What is Narrative Hack?

Narrative Hack is an engine for procedurally generating detailed, controllable, stories based on provided rules within a given environment. The generated stories are meant to serve as a base that can be built upon in a meaningful way or aid as a method of "filling in the blanks" for a given story. As long as the rules for a given environment are provided, the engine can continue forward, making decisions and guiding the path of the story, keeping note of the fine details that might be glanced over in standard writing.

Narrative Hack is designed as a writing helper for creating the foundation of a storyline, rather than a finished product.
